## Project Description
In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior. It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the center, the left and the right of the car).

The network is based on The [NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been proven to work in this problem domain.As image processing is involved, the model is using convolutional layers for automated feature engineering.
